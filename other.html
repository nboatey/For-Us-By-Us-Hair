        <h2>Other Hair Types</h2>
      <h3>Relaxed Hair</h3> <img src="images/perm.webp"class="img-fluid" alt="Type 4">
      <h4>Texture Change:</h4>
        <p>The primary goal of relaxing is to change the natural texture of the hair. Curly or coily hair becomes straight or loosely wavy after the relaxing process.</p>
      <h4>Chemical Treatment:</h4><p>Hair relaxing involves the use of chemicals, usually alkaline-based, to alter the structure of the hair shaft. It's important to follow the instructions carefully and be mindful of potential damage to the hair and scalp.</p>
      <h4>Maintenance:</h4><p>Relaxed hair requires regular maintenance to keep it healthy. This includes deep conditioning treatments, moisturizing, and protecting the hair from heat and environmental factors.</p>
      <h4>Vulnerability to Damage:</h4><p>Relaxed hair can be more susceptible to damage, breakage, and split ends. It's crucial to handle the hair gently and avoid excessive heat styling or harsh treatments.</p>
      <h4>Regrowth:</h4><p>As new hair grows from the roots, it will have the natural texture of the individual's hair. This means that individuals with relaxed hair will have to manage the contrast between their natural hair texture and the relaxed hair, requiring touch-ups or reapplication of the relaxer over time.</p>
      <h3>Locs</h3><img src="images/naturallocs.jpeg"class="img-fluid" alt="Locs">
      <h4>Formation:</h4><p>Locs are formed through a process of allowing the hair to naturally matte and lock together over time. This can be achieved through different methods, such as palm rolling, twisting, braiding, or the neglect method where the hair is allowed to naturally coil and knot.</p>
      <h4>Length and Thickness:</h4><p>The length and thickness of locs can vary widely. Some individuals prefer thin, well-defined locs, while others may opt for thicker, chunkier ones. The length of locs can range from short to very long, depending on individual preferences and the duration of growth.</p>
      <h4>Cultural Significance:</h4><p>Locs have cultural significance in various communities, including but not limited to Rastafarian, African, and African-American cultures. They can symbolize spirituality, cultural pride, and a connection to one's roots.</p>
      <h4>Maintenance:</h4><p>Proper maintenance is crucial for healthy and well-formed locs. Regular washing, moisturizing, and retwisting are common practices. However, there's a balance to be struck, as over-manipulation can lead to breakage.</p>
      <h4>Patience:</h4><p>The process of forming mature, well-defined locs requires patience. It can take months to years for locs to fully mature and reach their desired length.</p>
      <h4>Natural Journey:</h4><p>Locs often represent a natural hair journey for individuals who choose to embrace their hair's natural texture. They can be a low-maintenance option for those seeking a unique and distinctive hairstyle.</p>
      <h4>Individuality:</h4><p>Each set of locs is unique to the individual. Factors such as hair type, thickness, and the chosen method of loc formation contribute to the distinctive appearance of each person's locs.
